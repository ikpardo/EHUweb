abstract = "Nitrogen is one of the main factors that affect plant growth and development. However, high nitrogen concentrations can inhibit both shoot and root growth, even though the processes involved in this inhibition are still unknown. The aim of this work was to identify the metabolic alterations that induce the inhibition of root growth caused by high nitrate supply, when the whole plant growth is also reduced. High nitrate altered nitrogen and carbon metabolism, reducing the content of sugars and inducing the accumulation of Ca2+ and amino acids, such as glutamate, alanine and γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), that could act to replenish the succinate pool in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and maintain its activity. Other metabolic alterations found were the accumulation of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, and the reduction of jasmonic acid (JA) and the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). These results indicate that the growth root inhibition by high NO3- is a complex metabolic response that involves GABA as a key link between C and N metabolism which, together with plant growth regulators such as auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, JA, and the ethylene precursor ACC, is able to regulate the metabolic response of root grown under high nitrate concentrations."
