#One way we could make this different is to present the places of teaching as a smaller list with a click through to course descriptions and why we were teaching at that location. More in line with the project presentation line of reasoning. If we did each teaching engagement independently like a talk, and then aggregate them, then we could use schema.org metadata to describe each teaching engagement.

**Line 1**: To study the impact of climate change on barley, identifying agronomical, physiological, biochemical and molecular traits to select cultivars able to adapt to future climate conditions.


**Line 2**: To look for strategies for increasing legumesâ€™ productivity under climate change, selecting cultivars and Rhizobium strains of high symbiotic efficiency under controlled and field conditions either
in organic or conventional farming.

**Line 3**: To analyze the impact of extensive grazing abandonment on soil functions, biodiversity and forage quality in mountain grasslands under different changes in land use and climate change scenarios from a multidisciplinary perspective.

**Line 4**: To analyze resilience capacity to abiotic and biotic disturbances at individual, population and landscape scales in forest ecosystems, with a special emphasis in tree species main demographic rates (survival, growth and recruitment).
