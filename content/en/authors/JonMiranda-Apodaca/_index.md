My research focuses on the impact of climate change on plant physiology and biochemistry. I have studied impact on grassland communities and on crops, such as barley, wheat and quinoa. I have carried out field and growth chamber experiments to complement each other in the searching of the mechanisms underlying plant response to climate change.
