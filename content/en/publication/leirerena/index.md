abstract: Faced with the consequences of climate change, such as increased drought and     
 salinization of soils, the species Chenopodium quinoa may be a good alternative 
 crop because of its high tolerance to these conditions and 
 its high nutritional value. The objective of this work was 
 to analyze the response of the quinoa plant in drought and 
 salinity conditions. Under conditions of drought and 
 severe saline stress (500 mM NaCl), highly similar 
 reductions in growth and relative water content were 
 observed. However, the strategies implemented by the 
 plants in either stress condition and their relative 
 importance were different. Under salt conditions, 
 responses related to osmotic adjustment were more 
 prominent than under drought conditions, where more 
 dehydration was detected. In addition, despite a similar 
 reduction in stomatal conductance in drought and saline 
 conditions, a greater non-stomatal effect was observed in 
 drought conditions, which was demonstrated by the fact 
 that the intercellular CO2 concentration was increased.
 Moreover, the antioxidant metabolism also responded 
 differently to the two stresses. 
 Photoassimilate allocation was also different between 
 treatments:the root\/shoot ratio remained constant 
 independent of salt concentration, whereas under drought 
 conditions, this ratio increased. A similar trend between 
 treatments was detected for water use efficiency, which
 was maintained under salt stress and increased under 
 drought conditions, indicating that under reduced water 
 conditions, quinoa can use lower amounts of water per 
 unit of biomass production. These results suggest that 
 C. quinoa could be irrigated with brackish or even higher 
 salinity water without severely affecting the growth 
 during its early growth stage, thereby making C. quinoa 
 a promising alternative crop for arid and semi-arid regions.
